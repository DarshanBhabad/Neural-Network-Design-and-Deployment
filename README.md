# Neural-Network-Design-and-Deployment
🚀 Project OverviewThe objective of this assignment was to:Model Development: Design, train, and optimize a neural network.Architecture Selection: Transition from MLP to CNN for image data.Data Preprocessing: Implement normalization, reshaping, and one-hot encoding.Evaluation: Use loss functions (Categorical Crossentropy) and optimizers (Adam) to reach high accuracy.Deployment: Export the trained model for production use.📂 Repository StructureUntitled97.ipynb: The initial implementation using the standard MNIST Digits dataset with an MLP architecture (Accuracy: ~97.82%).ASSIGNMENT_NO_1.ipynb: The final assignment notebook using the Fashion-MNIST dataset with an optimized CNN architecture (Accuracy: ~91%).fashion_model_v1.h5: The serialized Keras model ready for deployment.🛠️ Tech StackPlatform: Google ColabHardware: NVIDIA T4 GPU (for CNN acceleration)Framework: TensorFlow / KerasLibraries: NumPy, Matplotlib, OS🧠 Model EvolutionPhase 1: MLP (Digits)Dataset: 28x28 Grayscale digits (0-9).Layers: Flatten -> Dense (200) -> Dense (150) -> Softmax (10).Why: Good for simple pattern recognition but lacks spatial awareness.Phase 2: CNN (Fashion)Dataset: Fashion-MNIST (T-shirts, Shoes, Bags, etc.).Architecture:Conv2D (32 filters): Detects edges and textures.BatchNormalization: Stabilizes training and speeds up convergence.MaxPooling2D: Reduces spatial dimensions.Dropout (0.3): Prevents overfitting by randomly deactivating neurons.Why CNN? Convolutional layers are superior for images as they extract local features and preserve spatial relationships, whereas MLPs flatten images and lose structural context.📊 ResultsDatasetArchitectureEpochsAccuracyMNIST DigitsMLP1097.82%Fashion-MNISTCNN1590.60%💻 How to RunOpen Google Colab.Upload the .ipynb files.Go to Runtime > Change runtime type and select GPU.Run all cells to train the model and generate the prediction visualizations.📁 DeploymentThe model is exported as an HDF5 file (.h5).
